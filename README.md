The purpose of this analyzation was to better understand Citi Bike's ideal client. 
The first piece of information that was gathered was the difference in the client's age range between the years of 2019 and 2020. Before Covid-19, majority of Citi Bike's users were riders in their early 20's. However, during Covid, the age range shifted to riders in their mid-70s. 
The other aspect of the ideal client was their gender. In both 2019 and 2020, majority of riders were female.
